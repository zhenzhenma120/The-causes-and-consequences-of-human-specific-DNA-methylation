### 01_02_betabinomial_regulation_classification
A two-model beta-binomial framework for classifying *cis* and *trans* regulatory effects on DNA methylation from allele-specific data in hybrid systems. Analyzes methylation differences between parental and hybrid alleles to classify CpG sites and genomic regions into regulatory categories.

See `readme.md` within folder for details.

### 03_identifying_denovo_regulation_DMRs
Differentially Methylated Region (DMR) detection using changepoint analysis and downstream genomic enrichment analysis with visualization.

See `readme.md` within folder for details.

### 04_transDMR_motif_visualization
Visualization of motif enrichment analysis for trans-regulated DMRs (Figure 3).

### 05_gene_expression_TMM_normalization
TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) normalized CPM (Counts Per Million) calculations for gene expression analysis (Figure 4).

### 06_expression_methylation_correlation
Correlation analysis between DNA methylation levels and gene expression, with bar plot visualizations (Figure 4).

### 07_sign_test
Sign test statistical analysis for directional consistency of regulatory effects (Figures 5 and 6).
